# CWE v0.6.0

Orchestration plugin. Delegation via hooks — follow systemMessage routing hints.

## Mistakes to avoid
- Don't handle tasks yourself when a CWE agent exists for it
- Don't skip memory updates after changes (memory/MEMORY.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- Run /cwe:help if unsure about available commands
